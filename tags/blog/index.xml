      <description>Sby, our formal verification tool has recently got better support for tristate circuits. A tristate output is one that can either drive the connected wire to a high or low logic level or be in a high impedance state where it does not drive the output. This allows directly connecting multiple tristate outputs as long as no two are driving the output simultaneously. With tribuf (tristate buffer) support turned on, sby will automatically create assertions for any tristate signals that can be driven via multiples outputs.</description>

      <title>Open Source Silicon with Yosys</title>

      <description>Yosys is probably best known for providing synthesis for FPGA targets, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very flexible tool capable of a lot more.
OpenLane, SiliconCompiler and Coriolis2 are 3 examples of open source ASIC flows, which has been an active field of development over the last year.
We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to see our tools get used in the first Google sponsored tapeouts, helping to make the world&amp;rsquo;s first chips made with an open source PDK, and open source all the way down to the designs.</description>
