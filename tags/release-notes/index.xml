      <description>SBY SBY now runs multiple tasks in parallel. Additionally it now limits the number of concurrently running subprocesses to the available number of cores. The &amp;ndash;sequential command line option allows you to opt out of running tasks in parallel and the -j N option sets the limit of concurrent subprocesses to N instead of the default. All this is optionally integrated with the make jobserver protocol to enforce the concurrent process limit across other processes launched by make.</description>

      <description>SBY SBY now uses a more precise logic loop analysis, removing the need to run simplemap on coarse-grain cells that re-use parts of a signal. In other YosysHQ news Since we introduced the new autotune option, we’ve now written up a blogpost with an example on how to get started. </description>

      <description>SBY An autotune function! This won’t fix your singing, but we hope it will help you to choose a good solver for your application. Please check the new documentation here to get started. Please let us know if you try the new feature. We will write a blogpost about it for the next newsletter. In other YosysHQ news Since tribuf support was added in May, we wrote a short blogpost about Matt’s use of it for his latest ASIC submission.</description>

      <description>Yosys A big overhaul of memory inference in Yosys. The new pass memory_libmap supports a wider variety of memory patterns, such as single-port memories or asymmetric memories. It will also strictly respect verilog semantics in cases of address collision, adding emulation circuitry to ensure the synthesized behavior matches simulation. To omit the emulation circuitry even in cases where it is required for correctness, you can add the (* no_rw_check *) attribute to the array declaration of the memory.</description>

      <description>SBY The tribuf pass now supports a -formal option that converts inferred tri-state buffers within a module into equivalent non-tri-state logic for formal verification. It automatically adds assertions that detect multiple drivers driving the same net simultaneously. (When using tri-state I/O across modules, tribuf -formal should be preceded by a flatten pass.) Several changes in the handling of x values during formal verification. In particular, when using the Verific frontend, during the initial time step, value change expressions ($rose, $fell, $changed, $stable) are now always computed as if the argument changed from x to its initial value.</description>

      <description>Yosys The sim command now allows co-simulation with stimulus values from aiger and btor2 witness files as well as traces in VCD or FST format. Co-simulation of designs with multiple clock domains was improved. SBY The &amp;ndash;keep-going option was added to the smtbmc engine. With this option, the solver will continue to check the remaining properties even after an assertion fails. To use it, add the option between the engine and the solver in the .</description>
