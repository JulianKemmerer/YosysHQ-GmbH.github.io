      <description>For a long time people have asked us for quality long form content that shows how to get the best from our formal tools.
We have started a series of app notes, with the first being about cover and witness for SVA properties. Otherwise known as &amp;lsquo;Am I testing what I think I&amp;rsquo;m testing&amp;rsquo;!
What You will learn in this app note:
 Default clocking and default disable declarations Sequences and cycle delays Overlapping and non-overlapping implication syntax and semantic Weak precondition cover and witness How to apply that to a practical HDL code example  https://yosyshq.</description>
