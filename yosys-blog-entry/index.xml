      <description>It seems that it was an accident - a generic part of a LED display has become a low cost FPGA development board. The board in question is the Colorlight 5A-75B, which is a so-called receiver card. Featuring a Lattice ECP5 FPGA, supported by Yosys, it allows you to leverage a fully open-source FPGA development toolchain. Priced on average at 20-25 USD, it is a very accessible board.
The Colorlight 5A-75B was originally a part of a modular LED display standard.</description>
